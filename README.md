# Stem Player Emulator

Below is the readme for the final official release of the Stem Player Emulator. This repo contains all releases of this program, faulty or functioning, for the intent of archiving software. We do not encourage piracy at all. We offer this software to be tinkered with or used by those who own the stem player. Those that use this software without owning the physical product are not our responsibility. The software in this repo falls under a grey area. Greets to the mediafire and soulseek gangs lmao.

This repository contains the source code of Kanye West's stem player. The original creator, krystalgamer, pulled down the extension. We will update this as time goes on. For now look at the current available forks of the original repo.

**THE TUTORIAL BELOW HAS INSTRUCTIONS FOR v0.7 BY KRYSTALGAMER. SOON THIS RELEASE WILL BECOME DEPRECATED, AND THEY MAY PATCH THE STEM PLAYER SITE. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO'S GOT THE SKILLS TO HELP MAINTAIN THIS NEW RELEASE TO KEEP UP WITH SITE CHANGES.**
