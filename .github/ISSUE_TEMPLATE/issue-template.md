Before opening an issue make sure to read the following message:

Kano has been updating their website so the emulator might stop working at any time without warning. If you just want to listen to the album then I suggest you to find mirrors online, if you wish to support the emulator then you can donate: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=N6QZL2267QYLU

Money will be used to buy the stemplayer and teardown for further reverse-engineering purposes.

If you're issue is not related to the stemplayer emulator not working then go ahead.
